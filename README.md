# Real-Date-Time-Clock-In-A-LCD-Monitor-Microcontroller-Arduino-C-Sharp-Project-By-AdarshVerma

Student: Adarsh Verma
Deadline: 2019 December 20th

Task: write a program code for any type of microcontroller or field programmable gate array (FPGA) which implements the following functions:

1. By default (development board powered on), the LCD shows real time clock.
2. LCD should have at least 2 rows that fit the following information:
a. Upper row: Year, Month, Day.
b. Lower row: Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Date format.
3. One button can be used to change the Date format in a cyclic manner. Default format is DMY.
Other options are: YMD, MDY. Date format indicator shows the active selection, and Upper row of the LCD changes accordingly.
4. Three additional buttons should also be used:
a. First button is used to cycle through the Upper and Lower row values (excluding Date format). When this button is pressed for the first time, the active (selected) value starts to
blink.
b. Second button is used to increase the value of the active selection.
c. Third button is used to decrease the value of the active selection.
d. If all three buttons are not pressed for 5 seconds, the active (selected) value stops blinking.

Additional information:

1. You can choose the programing language freely;
2. Chose or create a development board according to your task requirements;
3. You can use Arduino for this task, but code will be checked more thoroughly during final evaluation.
4. If acquiring hardware is difficult, it is possible to use simulation tools to showcase your code.

Final report content:

1. Analysis of task, similar work research;
2. Structure diagram of your system and program code;
3. Program code, with explanations for major blocks;
4. Verification and results of your task;
5. Conclusions.
